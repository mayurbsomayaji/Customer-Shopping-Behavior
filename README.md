# Customer Shopping Behavior

This project analyzes customer purchasing patterns to understand how factors like demographics, product categories, spending behaviour, and ratings influence shopping decisions. Using Python, Pandas, SQL, and visualization tools, it reveals insights that boost marketing, product placement, customer retention, overall business strategy, and planning.

## 🎯 Motivation  
Businesses want to understand *why* customers buy what they buy — which products, which segments, which channels, and with what ratings. This project aims to provide actionable insights that help optimize marketing efforts, inventory planning, and customer engagement.

## 🗂️ Data Description  
The dataset (`customer_shopping_behavior.csv`) contains customer purchase records including:  
- Demographics (age, gender, location)  
- Product categories purchased  
- Spend amount, frequency  
- Ratings/reviews  
- Time/season information  
Use the SQL file (`CSD.sql`) to explore/query underlying data.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools  
- **Python** with `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data cleaning, wrangling and visualization  
- **SQL** for structured querying of the data schema  
- **Power BI (.pbix file)** for interactive dashboard and story-telling  
- Jupyter Notebook (`CSB.ipynb`) covers full analysis and modelling  


## 📊 Key Insights  
- Which product categories sell most and to which demographic segments  
- Spending behaviour: high-value versus low-value customers  
- Relationship between ratings/reviews and repeat purchases  
- Seasonal or time-based spending trends  
- Recommendations for marketing strategy, product placement, and retention  

## ▶️ How to Run  
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/mayurbsomayaji/Customer-Shopping-Behavior.git`  
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if provided)  
3. Load the CSV in Python via Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis in `CSB.ipynb`  
4. Open the dashboard file `CSB.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to explore visualizations  

## 📈 Dashboard (.pbix)  
The Power BI file `CSB.pbix` contains the interactive dashboard allowing you to filter by demographics, product category, time period, and visualize spend/ratings. It complements the notebook analysis by offering business-friendly views.
